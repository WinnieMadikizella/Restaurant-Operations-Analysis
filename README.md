# üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Operations Analysis

## Project Overview
The Restaurant Operations Analysis project focuses on evaluating sales performance, customer preferences, and pricing strategies using data from the menu_items and order_details tables. The goal is to generate actionable insights that can help optimize menu offerings, pricing structures, and overall restaurant profitability.

## Data Source
Maven Dataset
- `menu_items.csv` - consists of menu_item_id, item_name, category and price.
- `order_details.csv` - consists of order_details_id, order_id, order_date, order_time and item_id.

  ## Technologies Used
- **SQL** (Data analysis & queries)

## Goals of the Project
### 1. Menu Performance Analysis
- Assess the number of menu items and their distribution across categories.
- Identify the most and least expensive dishes and their respective categories.
- Evaluate price variations within menu categories.

### 2. Customer Order Behavior
- Analyze total orders and items sold.
- Identify the most and least frequently ordered items.
- Examine bulk purchase trends and customer preferences for large orders.

### 3. Revenue Optimization
- Identify high-value orders and their composition.
- Determine which menu categories contribute most to overall revenue.
- Understand customer spending patterns and their impact on profitability.

## Business Needs Addressed
1. Menu Optimization: Identify underperforming items and potential menu adjustments.
2. Pricing Strategy Improvement: Evaluate how price influences order volume and revenue.
3. Sales Growth: Use data-driven insights to increase average order value and frequency.
4. Customer Retention: Develop strategies to enhance customer loyalty and repeat purchases.

## Methodology: How Insights Were Discovered
### Data Exploration:
- Analyzed the menu_items and order_details tables to understand menu composition and order trends.
- Used SQL queries to retrieve key statistics such as order counts, item popularity, and revenue distribution.

### Sales and Customer Analysis:
- Identified top-selling and least-selling items.
- Assessed category-wise performance to determine revenue contributions.
- Examined high-value orders to understand spending behaviors.

### Presentation of Insights:
- Aggregated data using SQL functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG) for trend analysis.
- Structured findings into meaningful insights with key takeaways.

## üìä Key Findings & Recommendations
- **Italian dishes are the most popular and drive high-value orders**. Expanding this category and introducing premium meal bundles could boost revenue.
- **American dishes have the lowest average price**. A pricing strategy review may be necessary to improve profitability.
- **Chicken Tacos, the least ordered item, may need to be reevaluated**. Promotions or menu adjustments could enhance its appeal.
